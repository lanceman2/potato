# We are using quickbuild.make from
# https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lanceman2/quickbuild/$tag/quickbuild.make
# where $tag is master or a sha1 git hash we'll pin down if we need to.

# quickbuild.make reads this file for package specific configuration
# and config.make for build instance configuration.
